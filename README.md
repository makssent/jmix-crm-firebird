### ✨ Main Features

This project models a typical B2B sales workflow:

- Manage the catalog of products and categories
- Maintain clients, contacts, and addresses
- Track orders through the sales funnel
- Issue invoices and record payments
- Plan and monitor user tasks
- Ask the built-in AI assistant for business insights
- See sales analytics on the dashboard and in built-in reports

#### 📈 Sales Automation

`B2B CRM` helps sales managers automate the sales process: the system keeps track of deals, invoices, payments
and user tasks, and provides quick analytics on clients. For example, it can quickly answer typical questions such as:

- How many deals are at the presale stage or awaiting payment, and for what total amount
- Which clients are the revenue leaders and which are the outsiders — and in which product categories
- How often the selected clients make purchases
- How proposals for a client compare to each other, and what were the maximum discounts for a particular product category

Normally, such requests require configuring specialized reports and analyst expertise. In `B2B CRM` it is enough to
write the request in natural language: the built-in [AI Assistant](#-ai-assistant)
helps analyze sales by aggregating data on deals, invoices, and payments while respecting the user's data access
permissions.

#### 🔽 Sales Funnel

The `Orders` screen features an interactive sales funnel based on order statuses: 
`New` → `Accepted` → `In Progress` →`Done`. 
Each stage shows the number of orders at that stage, and a single click takes the manager to the orders of the
selected stage — with the total, invoiced, paid, and remaining amounts for each order.

## 🤖 AI Assistant

The application includes a built-in `CRM AI` workspace for natural-language analysis of CRM data.

#### ✨ Key capabilities:

- Ask business questions about clients, orders, invoices, payments, and sales performance
- Upload entities and files to the conversation context
- Respect the current user's data access permissions and keep conversations private to their author
- Use built-in business reports such as `Client 360 Report` and `Category Cashflow Risk Allocation Report`
- Keep the conversation history with automatically generated chat titles
- Generate interactive links to CRM records directly in responses

#### ⚙️ Configuration:

Set `spring.ai.openai.api-key` in [application.properties](src/main/resources/application.properties) 
or provide the `SPRING_AI_OPENAI_APIKEY` environment variable.

When enabled, open the `CRM AI` item in the main menu to start a new conversation.

> Why is Jmix good for building CRM systems?

CRM systems have become the backbone of modern enterprise automation, moving far beyond a simple system of records. As
business requirements in sales change rapidly, CRM systems must also provide capabilities to implement quick changes in
workflows, data model, and UX while preserving high security and compliance standards. Jmix provides these capabilities
out of the box, allowing developers to focus on business logic instead of infrastructure. This demo demonstrates how
production-ready enterprise applications can be developed using Jmix and AI.

> Is this a real application or just a demo?

B2B CRM is a demo application designed to demonstrate production-ready architecture and enterprise development
practices. It includes real business scenarios, modern UI, AI capabilities, security, reporting, and integration
patterns that can be reused in your own enterprise projects.
